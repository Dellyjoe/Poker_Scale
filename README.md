# Project: Poker Scale

## Phase 1

* Develop a scale that weighs a stack of poker chips, each weighing 10 grams.
* The scale should report the total value of the poker chips.

## Phase 2

* Enhance the scale to weigh multiple stacks of poker chips, with each stack having a different value.
* The system should sum the total value of all the poker chips.
* Attach a display to show the user the total amount.
